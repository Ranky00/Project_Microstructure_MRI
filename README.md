# Project_Microstructure_MRI
Overview of the Code

The provided code is designed to create texture features from Regions of Interest (ROI). These features include various statistical measures like means, standard deviations, p-values, and t-values. It focuses on extracting both first and second-order radiomics features for a thorough analysis of the data.
Steps Involved:

    Feature Extraction:
        First-Order Features: Basic statistical measures derived from pixel intensity values.
        Second-Order Features: Measures that capture the spatial relationship between pixels.

    Computation:
        Calculation of statistical measures for each feature.
        Organization of these computed features into a structured format.

    Output:
        Compilation of the organized results into a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file.
        The CSV format is chosen for its structured and easily interpretable nature, aiding in subsequent analysis.

Purpose:

    Facilitates Subsequent Analysis:
    The CSV file can be imported into various data analysis tools, enabling further statistical examinations and visualization techniques.
